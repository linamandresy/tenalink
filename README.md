# üåê TenaLink ‚Äî Trustworthy Work References on the Blockchain

TenaLink is a decentralized system for issuing and validating professional **references**, **certificates**, and **recommendations**, especially designed to help **immigrants and newcomers** prove their foreign work experience **without relying on banks or centralized authorities**.

It uses the **Stellar blockchain** to anchor trust and link people through **verified connections**. Our unique graph-based model allows endorsements to be trusted based on relationship paths.

## üöÄ Features

- Issue certificates and reference letters with **blockchain-verifiable authenticity**
- Trust-based graph model: nodes (people) are verified by other trusted nodes
- Each certificate is linked to a Stellar transaction for **immutable, timestamped proof**
- No banks, no fiat ‚Äî trust and proof without the need for traditional financial systems
- Built with **Golang**, **React**, **Stellar SDK**, and **Docker**

## üîó How Blockchain is Used

We use the **Stellar testnet** to:

1. **Create a transaction** that includes certificate metadata (hash, date, signer ID)
2. Store the hash of this metadata in the transaction memo or a data entry
3. Return the transaction hash to the frontend to link the reference forever
4. Let third parties verify that:
   - The reference was issued
   - When it was issued
   - Who issued it (via public key and graph trust)

üõ†Ô∏è Tools:
- `Stellar SDK (Go)`
- `Horizon API`
- `Memo fields` for metadata hash anchoring

## üåç Problem Solved

TenaLink addresses the problem of **‚Äúlack of Canadian experience‚Äù** or **unrecognized foreign references** faced by newcomers. Our decentralized, blockchain-backed model:
- Validates work history internationally
- Doesn‚Äôt rely on banks or national institutions
- Gives control to individuals and communities to **vouch for each other**
